# CS848 Project
The following files contain the code used in the CS848 Project. 
It contains two files for three types of databases (nested, flat, hybrid).
## Data Generator
Each database structure has a data generator file that populates the database with sample data. The file just has to be run with a service account key to any Firebase Realtime Database and it will populate it with that data.
## DB Calls
Each database structure also has a DBCalls file that retrieves data from every API route for that corresponding database. The file also has to be run with the same service account key used for the data generator file and it will retrieve the code accordingly.
